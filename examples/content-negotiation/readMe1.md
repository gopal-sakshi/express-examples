content negotiation 
- is the mechanism that is used for serving different representations of a resource

The server chooses one of the variants available 
– each variant is called a representation 
– and returns a specific representation to the client
– The overall resource, as well as each of the representations, has a specific URL

You can send the response as
- json
- html
- text
